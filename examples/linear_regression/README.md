# Dot Product Tutorial

This tutorial shows how to train a linear regression privately based on the closed-form solution to linear regression.

This is an implementation on the [paper by Blom et al.](https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/773.pdf)

## üö® Limitations
The choice for blind computing implies certain trade-offs in comparison to conventional computing. What you gain in privacy, you pay in extra computational overhead & capacity constraints.

Therefore, you will notice that large-scale computational workloads may lead to long compilation and/or execution times or hitting network capacity guardrails.

That said, the Nillion team is working around the clock to push the boundaries of this technology and bring the potential of blind computing to reality üöÄ

üëâ This example has been tested on local devnet with the current given dimension of 3 x 3.
